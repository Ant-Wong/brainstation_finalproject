# Electric City

Electric City is a Full Stack web application built to connect artists, producers, bands and song writers together! For example, if you're a band that's missing a drummer but you're tired of using Craigslist or other platforms that can be cluttered you can search, listen to their work and connect. 

Users will be able to create a unique profile that shows who they are, where they're based, their title (producer, guitarist, singer) and genre they specialize in. Users will be able to search for others to connect with. You can search by name, genre, and/or title.
